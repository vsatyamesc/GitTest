We reached the sea!!
*Out of bubble - This time our group will be having fun playing in the water♪ ......or is it?
This is the sea where the "scale" was, right?!!
Let's go find the mermaid right away, Dou-sama!
Ms. Mermaaid!
A mermaid’s scale?
Yes! Apparently, Dou-sama found it on the beach the other day
I was surprised because the mermaid Setia had told me that the scales almost never peel off...
I investigated further and...
I found a mysterious cell that stopped moving
A mysterious cell?
Yes, I think...

Page 2

It may have something to do with the secret of "mermaid’s eternal youth"
We can’t let this go by! Dou-sama! Could you please guide us to the beach where the scales were!?
Ok!
"Eternal youth cells"... If it really exists, it would be a discovery that will have its mark in the Demon World’s history
If research continues, it may even be possible to grant immortality to all demons...
Muushu, I’ll be helping y...
Hmgh!?
Hmgh gh gh  gh!? (Se... Setia-sama!?)
Shh!
If you go, my “younger sister” will get scared
Y... Younger sister?
...... Uhh, there are some scary looking people...

Page 3

Today is a bad day
Now that I was engrossed doing handicrafts
What should I do...? Even if I go back to the sea, I'll have to deal with my extroverted older sisters
I guess I have no choice but to lie low here...
Ms. Mermaid!
Waaah!? W... w... w... who are you!?
Hm?
Waaaah! It’s a beautiful necklace, is it Ms. Mermaid’s!?

Page 4

Dou-sama? Who are you talkin...?
Waaaaaaaaah!!!

Page 5

Uuuh...!!
Hiii!!
Hii!
Waah!?
Ehehehe, you two look alike!
Huh?

Page 6

... Erm... S... 
Sorry for scaring you just now!
My name is Muushu, I’m a witch!
I came here wanting to know more about mermaids
How is your everyday life, differences in your ecosystem
And also, the secret for eternal youth
As a researcher, I want to solve this mystery
If you don't mind, could you please tell me as much as you can?
P... please, I ask for your cooperation!!

Page 7

......... What do you want me to tell you?
It’s about this...
... Yes, that is definitely a mermaid scale
R... Really!? But I heard that mermaid scales don't peel off, so this...
It came off
That's what happens when we don't sing the "song"
“Song”?
The original purpose of mermaids singing
Isn’t to lure evil sailors and sink them into the sea...
But to “maintain their beauty”
By singing, mermaids start shining and become prettier, almost as if they have been rejuvenated

Page 8

! I see...!! That’s the secret for mermaids' eternal youth!
In other words, when mermaids sing, the cells in their scales get stimulated, they shine and rejuvenate!!
Uh... Hm, probably
Dou want to hear you singiing!!
Me too, I want to hear Ms. Mermai...
No way!!
I can’t sing! And don’t want to!!
W... Why?
... I don’t like it
Because my voice, personality and appearance...
Are all too different from the other mermaids
So sorry, I can’t sing
Ms. Mermaid...

Page 9

Then we will sing!!
Whaat!?
Ms. Mermaid can teach us, and we sing in her place!
Then it might start to shine
N... No, I don’t think...
Nice idea, Dou-sama!
The probability for this shouldn’t be zero!
Please Ms. Mermaid!
Could you please teach us the song!?
Errm...
......If... If it’s just a little bit
!! Yaaay!!

Page 10

...... Fufu
? Setia-sama, did you hear something?
I can’t hear very well from here...
No, it was nothing
I’m just...
A little happy
**Dou out of bubble - Raaa♪ NaaDoo
Wawawawawaaa

Page 11

Fuuh...! How was it, Ms. Mermaid!?
Can we make it shine with this?
Errm...
I think it might be difficult if Dou doesn't memorize better the lyrics
And... Muushu... erm......... maybe you are too much out of tune
Lyrics are hard...
Am... I...... tone deaf.........
Ah, it... it’s not your fault
It's probably because my teaching method is poor...

Page 12

Sorry, I... I can’t sing and am bad at swimming
Whatever I do, I'm usually clumsy... and awkward...
M... Me too!
Me too
I can understand it because I'm a clumsy witch who always fails at everything I do and never get things right!
Muushu too...?
Yes! Also, before I was more negative and lacked confidence in myself...
But Dou-sama taught me
That there are things in which even I can shine

Page 13

So, Ms. Mermaid too, have more confidence in yourself!
Also, your teaching method was easy to understand! And most importantly, it was a lot of fun!
Hm! Dou wants to sing more!
Dou-sama, Muushu
It’s almost time to go back home
What!?
It’s already this late...
Ugh... we ended up not being able to learn it by today
Now all we can do is to practice on our own...
“Nadirie”
Hm?

Page 14

It’s my name, “Nadirie”
So... Erm... Well...
You can come 
Again......
Yes!!! For sure we will come here again tomorrow, Nadirie!!
Right, Dou-sama!!?
Dou will come too!!

Page 15

Higher
Aah
Lower
AaA...
... A little higher
Th... this is hard!
Nitoee?
It’s niitue
Try saying it slow
Niii...-te!!
A... Almost
How is your day-to-day, Nadirie?
I... am always hiding in the shadow of my sister while being gloomy
My room is also dark, and I don’t talk to anyone
Ooh... I understand darkening the room
When you want to be by yourself, being alone in a dark, cold, dust smelling room with the door locked makes you feel at ease, doesn’t it?
I really get it...
You’ll get a cold
Muushu, well... do you have a type of men you like?
 Whaaat!? I... I... I... I don’t really know about those things...... What about you, Nadirie?
Act... Actually, I was asked this by my sister... And I didn’t really know either
... By the way, does Dou-sama have a type?
Dou does!
What!? Really!?
Dou likes people with smooth heads!!
What the heck!?!

Page 16

A few days later...
Nadirie onee-chan!
Nadirie! This time...
Yes! You sang it perfectly!

Page17

We did iiiiiiiit!!
We finally managed to sing it, Dou-sama!!
Ehehehe, we sang it very well!!
Ah! That means
With this the scale should start shini......
It isn’t!!?
Noo... Whyy...?
Did Dou make a mistake again?
No... I think it must need a mermaid's singing voice after all
I see... Uugh, we practiced so much...
But Dou had lots of fuun!!

Page 18

Thanks to Nadirie onee-chan, Dou's singing got better and did lots of talking!
I... It was nothin...
That’s right...! And most importantly
Thanks to this we could meet Nadirie and become “friends”!
This makes me happier than any research result!
 ......
Muushu! Dou!

Page 19

Sing with me
Doing it alone... makes me nervous
Huh... Nadirie, are you...

Page 20

... What a beautiful voice...
E... even our scales are shining...
Nadirie...
Muushu onee-chan

Page 21

Let’s sing together!!
......!! Yes!!

Page 22

!! The scale...
It’s shiniiiing!!
Yeeeeeeees!!!
We did iit! It shined, Nadirie!!
Hm...!
It's all thanks to Nadirie! I've never heard such a crystal-clear singing voice in my life before!!
It was soo beautiful!!
I was able to sing because of the two of you
So, it’s thanks to all of us

Page 23

I just... Wanted to respond to your feelings
Because you two... are my first “friends”
Nadirieeeeee!!!
Ugh!? Ne... Nee-sama!?
Finally... You finally have people to call each other friends...!!
S... Stop it, it’s embarassing!!
... Dou-sama, I’ve made my mind
Hm?

Page 24

You made the scale......
A token of your friendship...!?
Yes! Nadirie made this for us!
It’s our treasure!
Riight!?
Scale necklace
What about the research!? What’ll happen to it!?
Scale keyholder
It's okay! The mermaids said they'll let me know if a scale come off again!
...... How many...
How many hundreds of years will it take for that to happeeeen!!!?
